# 📊 Data Column Progression Chart – Power BI Project

## Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard was developed to track and validate the completeness of key date-related fields in the training records of PQP Marketing Consult. The aim was to ensure data accuracy in critical columns such as training start dates and payment installment dates.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

The institution's dataset contained inconsistent or missing values in important date columns:
- Start Date
- Payment Category 1 Date
- Payment Category 2 Date
- Payment Category 3 Date

These gaps made it difficult to monitor participant onboarding, payment status, and revenue projections. The data team needed a simple yet powerful way to visualize and correct these issues.

## ✅ Solution & Actions Taken

- **Data Cleaning & Validation:**
  - Assessed each column for missing or incorrect values.
  - Labeled entries as **Corrected** or **Not Corrected**.

- **Dashboard Features:**
  - Progress bars to visually represent the percentage of corrected vs. uncorrected data.
  - Color-coded bars (✅ Green for corrected, ❌ Red for not corrected).
  - KPI cards for revenue, total registration, activation, and conversion ratio.

- **Correction Progress:**
  - `Start Date`: 76.3% Corrected | 23.7% Not Corrected
  - `Payment Category 1`: 99.9% Corrected
  - `Payment Category 2`: 89.16% Corrected
  - `Payment Category 3`: 99.07% Corrected
